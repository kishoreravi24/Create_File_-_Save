# Create_File_-_Save

## Done by using pure node js and html as view, Node js(npm) packets (FS,HTTP,ALERT-NODE) and created without framework(Express).

## Used to create txt file with file name and text and the file saved on consant folder.


*** personal view after creating this project, creating a project without framework like express gives more complex and understanding of pure node js, using http(server) I learned how to use elegant code without framework  ***
